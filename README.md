# Welcome to VoteChat: Behind the Scenes!

### Created in Northeastern Media Innovation Studio I

Whether you're a new voter who needs to know what ID to bring to the polls or a voting virtuoso who wants a recap of new laws in your state â€“ We get it.

VoteChat is a virtual chatbot that informs you on current and changing voting laws that may affect your right to vote. Some laws expand accessibility, while others restrict it, making the process more complicated since each state and territory has their own rules and requirements. Being able to vote with confidence is a basic right. We're here to help you understand what voting laws mean and how to prepare. From registration deadlines to requesting mail-in ballots to voting in-person, VoteChat has all the answers.
